Project:  Project1-About Me
Name: Christian Durrant
Submitted: 10/12/2025
 
I declare that the following source code was written by me, or provided
by the instructor for this project. I understand that copying source
code from any other source, providing source code to another student, 
or leaving my code on a public web site constitutes cheating.
I acknowledge that  If I am found in violation of this policy this may result
in a zero grade, a permanent record on file and possibly immediate failure of the class.
 
Reflection: This assignment at first was something that I was worried about doing, it seemed like a lot of different things that would be hard to integrate together, 
especially as someone who never has worked in HTML. However this assignment was actually pretty simple, if a little time consuming. I feel like I've learned a lot of
useful skills that I will be able to use in future projects.
